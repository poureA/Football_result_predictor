# Football_result_predictor
As a Football fan, l've always thought about creating something to help clubs set the best lineup for their next match. Since I work as an Al developer, I decided to develop a tool that predicts the probability of a match result as a percentage. I used FotMob data to create software that provides Football clubs with insights into their rivals based on previous results. The data for this project is sourced manually. It consists of match results from each round of the 2023/2024 season.
The objective is to develop a Machine Learning system that predicts the probabilities of Win, Loss, and Draw based on the input data.
