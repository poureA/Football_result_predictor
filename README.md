# Football_result_predictor

As a Football fan, I've always thought about creating something to help clubs set the best lineup for their next match. So I decided to develop a tool that predicts the probability of a match result as a percentage. I used Fotmob data to create software that provides Football clubs with insights into their rivals based on previous results. The ML model is trained on match results in season 2023/2024.
